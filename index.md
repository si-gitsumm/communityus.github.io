## Manifesto or Antithesis?

**Good artists copy, great artists steal.** (Yates et al. 1967)

_Playing around with the idea of an open company and exploring what that means. Our world is already so bound and licensed - everyone wants their piece of the pie.  Our goal is to let everyone eat their pie. We provide the tin the pie is cooked in and endeavor to comply with all applicable standards. We don't provide the table you eat the pie on, we encourage you to use a cloth napkin. Where is the spoon and the fork in this allegory? Remember there is no spoon. Forks are welcome and encouraged._ However we have nothing against tables, and encourage you to shop around and try several tables during a lifetime. We also donâ€™t take ourselves too seriously. Yes this is all metaphor for what we do.


**Good code is forked, great code is stolen.** ```tongue-in-cheek```

Gitsumm.org is a video game development studio formed and founded by Stephen Reynolds in early 2014. His vision and dream is to create an online gaming platform and community in which people could not only enjoy the works created by us here at Gitsumm.org, but also to share their own work and projects as well.

While our website is currently under development and our team is still building and developing our own introductory titles, the final result will be an environment in which outside independent developers can submit their games to be hosted by us and played by the community. Marked incentives will give players and game developers, alike, rewards for their work and play. While these details are not currently revealed, we are highly anticipating the day that we can share the full release to the public audience.

Our list of games will come with access to our Gitsumm.org custom leaderboard and competitive environment, in which players can monitor their own ranking among other players, see how well they fare against the highest ranked players, and even compete against their friends. Until then, sample our games, watch as we increase the list of titles we have created, and add additional features for our registered members to enjoy.

Artists, musicians, developers, and creators of all sorts of assets will one day be able to upload their items for sale, through our website at very competitive rates. We are working daily to develop the features that will allow you to show off your creations, such as the custom 3D Viewer which is currently displaying our catalog of 3D flowers.

Our forums will one day be a carefully attended environment of game development and social interaction. Aside from the general bustle and life of a standard forum, Gitsumm.org team members will participate in online discussions and be available to answer some questions and help others grow and learn the trade and business around game development. We have our own batch of special features planned for the forums including tutorial videos and a special type of quiz game associated with those videos to help our community learn while having fun at the same time.

Gitsumm.org has come a long way in the past few months and we plan to continue developing and growing as a team. We humbly encourage you to look around, test out our systems and games, and let us know what you think.
